# 📌 Introduction to Networking

## 🔹 What is Networking?
Networking refers to the process of **connecting multiple devices** (computers, servers, routers, etc.) to share resources and communicate with each other. It enables data exchange through wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections.

### 🔑 Key Functions of Networking:
- **Data Sharing** – Enables communication between devices.  
- **Resource Sharing** – Allows access to shared printers, servers, and databases.  
- **Remote Access** – Supports cloud computing and remote work.  
- **Security & Control** – Provides authentication and network policies.

## 🔹 Importance of Networking in DevOps & Cloud Computing  

### 🌐 **Why is Networking Critical?**  
- **Cloud Services**: Enables connectivity between cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:  IaC enables the automated provisioning of infrastructure, which speeds up the 
deployment process and reduces the time required to set up new environments. (Terraform, Ansible).  
- **Scalability & Availability**: Load balancers and CDNs ensure smooth performance.  
- **Security & Compliance**: Firewalls, VPNs, and IAM (Identity Access Management) policies Protecting network     
infrastructure, data, and communication from unauthorized access, attacks, and threats.  

### 📌 **Real-World Use Cases:**  
✔ **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines rely on network communication for deployments.  
✔ **Cloud Networking**: Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) connect cloud resources securely.  
✔ **Microservices**: Kubernetes networking handles container communication.

## 🔹 Basic Networking Concepts  

### 1️⃣ **IP Addresses**  
- **IPv4** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) – 32-bit address system.  
- **IPv6** (e.g., `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`) – 128-bit, more scalable.  
- **Public vs. Private IPs** – Public IPs are used on the internet; private IPs are for local networks.  

### 2️⃣ **MAC Addresses**  
- Unique identifier for network interfaces (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).  
- Helps in identifying devices within a local network.  

### 3️⃣ **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
- Translates **domain names** (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses (`142.250.180.14`).  
- Works via a **hierarchical structure** of DNS servers.  

### 4️⃣ **Subnetting**  
- Divides large networks into smaller subnetworks (subnets).  
- **CIDR Notation**: Example - `192.168.1.0/24` (256 addresses in this range).

✅ **Key components** include IP addresses, MAC addresses, DNS, and subnetting.  
✅ **Understanding networking** helps in designing secure, scalable, and efficient systems.
